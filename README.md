# Treehouse Personal Profile Page

# Project Overview

To complete this project, follow the instructions below. If you get stuck, ask a question on Slack or in the Treehouse Community. The aim is to take the information given to create a personal profile site.

# Instructions

### 1. Create or find an image file to represent yourself and a new image for the background. Be aware of file size: keep the profile image under 400 KB and the background image under 1 MB

(see the link in the resources section to Picresize, an online image resizing tool).

### 2. Using a text editor, modify the HTML of the index.html file:

- Add the images you collected in step 1 to the page. Please leave the class "profile-image" intact on your profile image.
- Don't forget to update your new profile image's alt attribute!
- Personalize the text on the page by changing the name, background and goals. Feel free to make up the information if you do not wish to share anything personal.
- Adding links to your GitHub, Twitter and LinkedIn accounts. If you don't have a Twitter or LinkedIn account, or don't want to share those, then delete those links.
- Feel free to expand on this project, by adding an additional page or two, adding more images and customizing the CSS.
- If you do not want to add an additional page then delete the experience link in the HTML.

### 3. Put your project in a new GitHub repository on your GitHub account:

- See the workshop on Using GitHub for the Degree Program (linked in the Additional Resources section). The GitHub Desktop application can automatically create a new repository for you.
- Make sure that you're only putting the files for this project in that repository.

### 4. Make sure to check your code is valid by running it through an HTML and CSS validator.

- Links to the validators can be found in the Project Resources. This will help you spot any errors that might be in your code.

  **There are a few exceptions that you don’t need to fix:**

  - Don’t worry about any warnings, we just need you to check any errors that might be there.
  - If CSS validator flags use of calc, vendor prefixes or pseudo-elements/pseudo-classes these errors should be ignored.
  - If HTML validator flags use of pipe (‘|’) in Google font links/URLs this error can also be ignored.

# Extra Credit

### 1. Add more photos and imagery to the page

### 2. Style the profile photo with additional CSS properties

### 3. Add more text to the page

# Notes from tests

Part 4 of the project instructions notes that HTML validators will create an error when the pipe character is used and to ignore it. This issue arises in the Treehouse automated testing.
