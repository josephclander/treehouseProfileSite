          As a teacher I have had lots of experience of trying to create
          something that is best for the user to understand. The best lessons
          are formed from activities where the student can play with the ideas
          and figure out how concepts work for themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also as Deputy Head of department of Maths, I have held a lot of
          responsibilities; keeping a team working well together, training new
          staff in new practices and keeping check that we are all providing the
          same high standard of content.
        </p>
        <p>
          The background design you see on the home page was created by one of
          my younger classes. They were exploring the relevance of the code that
          goes into old games and how Maths has improved the gameplay and
          graphics.

          I have worked on the up keep of a small website but wanted to learn
          how to push out more materials to the students. I started making a few
          screencasts, which turned into a
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSWZMMeFFNchAF3DSbxIEQQ"
            >Youtube</a
          >
          page and now learning to build my own websites to host these materials
          the way I want to.
        </p>
        <p>
          My experience to date includes completing HTML/CSS courses with Free
          Code Camp, General Assembly and now working through Tree House's
          Techdegree.

        <p>
          With a degree in Mathematics and an A-Level in French, I have gained
          an interest in Javascript. I have learned much of the syntax and when
          I become proficient in frontend design, I wish to take this further to
          add interactivity and explore the possibilities of backend
          development.
